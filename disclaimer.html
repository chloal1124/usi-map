    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>General purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The Urban Stress Index (USI) is provided for <strong>informational and comparative purposes only</strong>.
        It is intended to support high-level discussion of cost-of-living pressure across cities,
        not to serve as financial, housing, or investment advice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not personalised advice</h2>
      <p>
        USI is calculated using city-level averages or medians and a standardised set of assumptions.
        It does not account for individual circumstances such as household composition, lifestyle choices,
        tax position, assets, subsidies, or employer-specific benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actual living costs and affordability may differ materially from the values presented.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interpretation of results</h2>
      <p>
        USI is a <strong>structural indicator</strong>, not a measure of personal hardship or quality of life.
        Cities with similar USI values may differ significantly in public services, social safety nets,
        housing quality, and non-monetary factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users should avoid drawing conclusions based on USI alone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data accuracy and timeliness</h2>
      <p>
        Data used in USI calculations are sourced from publicly available datasets and private-sector market reports.
        While reasonable care has been taken to select reliable sources, no guarantee is made regarding
        accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cost-of-living conditions may change rapidly due to market movements, policy changes,
        or macroeconomic factors.
