<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
The Urban Stress Index (USI) measures the share of a typical monthly income dispensed as essential housing and food costs for a single person with a local full time job
It combines two core components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Housing burden</strong> – calculated as monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment divided by typical monthly income.</li>
  <li><strong>Essential food share</strong> – calculated as the estimated cost of a standardized essential dining pattern divided by typical monthly income.</li>
</ul>

<p>
USI is defined as:
<br>
<strong>USI = Housing burden + Essential food share</strong>
</p>

<p>
All values are expressed as percentages of monthly income in local currency.
The index is designed to provide a comparable indicator of cost-of-living pressure across cities, focusing on baseline expenses.
</p>

<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>
Income figures are based on nationally reported typical or median monthly earnings.
Rental data reflects prevailing market rates for one-bedroom apartments within the metropolitan area.
Food costs are derived from standardized essential grocery basket estimates designed to represent a lifestyle of occational dining-out in the local area.
</p>

<p>
All data are compiled from publicly available national statistics agencies, rental market listings, and aggregated consumer price datasets.
Values represent typical market conditions at the time of data collection.
