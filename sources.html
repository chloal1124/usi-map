  <h2>Europe</h2>

  <p>
European data sources are grouped by country. Official national statistical agencies are prioritised for income data wherever available. Where harmonised city-level rent series are not consistently available across countries, publicly available rental market datasets are used as cross-country proxies. All values are expressed in local currency unless otherwise stated.
</p>

<p>
In cases where city-level income data are not publicly available, a proxy based on the reported salary range of a junior mechanical engineer (1–3 years of experience) from Glassdoor is applied. For housing, the indicator “1 Bedroom Apartment in City Centre” from Numbeo is used as a rental cost proxy in markets lacking consistent official rent statistics.
